* Casual Dired
An opinionated [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]]-based porcelain for the Emacs file manager [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][Dired]].

[[file:docs/images/casual-dired-screenshot.png]]


* Motivation
While highly functional, Dired has a steep learning curve as it relies on single-key bindings for many of its commands. Menus are a user interface (UI) affordance that offer users discoverability and recall that can lower Dired's learning curve. While menus are commonly associated with mouse-driven UI, the inclusion of Transient in Emacs core allows for a menu UI that is keyboard-driven. Casual Dired endeavors to offer this as many Emacs users prefer keyboard-driven workflows.

** Goals
- To provide a keyboard-driven menu UI to Dired.
- To provide casual access to common file manager operations.

** Non-Goals
- Full coverage of all Dired commands. Casual Dired is not intended to be a power user tool.
- Strict adherence to default Dired keybindings. That said, most Dired keybindings are honored.
- Strict adherence to Dired command naming. While Casual Dired is *mostly* in alignment with Dired’s command naming, there are cases where it will make an opinionated change if the name is deemed too vague or idiomatic.
- UX Stability (for now). Given that Casual Dired is early in its life-cycle, expect changes to its user experience in terms of menu hierarchy and keybinding choices in future releases.

* Requirements

Casual Dired has been verified with the following configuration. 
- Emacs 29.3 (macOS 14.4.1, Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4 LTS)
- GNU ~ls~ (coreutils 9.5)
- ImageMagick ~identify~ (ImageMagick 6.9.13)

The Casual Dired /Sort By/ feature relies on the installation of GNU ~ls~. The Casual Dired /Image Info/ feature relies on the ~indentify~ CLI utility. Both programs must be configured (typically via ~PATH~) so that they are available to Emacs. There is no checking by Casual Dired to verify that either the aforementioned utilities are installed.

Users with earlier versions of GNU coreutils and ImageMagick may still be able to use Casual Dired.

* Asks
As Casual Dired is new, we are looking for early adopters! Your [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-dired/discussions][feedback]] is welcome as it will likely impact Casual Dired's evolution, particularly with regards to UI.

* Install
If installed via MELPA (TBD) then add this line to your Emacs initialization file.
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-dired)
  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-o") 'casual-dired-tmenu)
#+end_src

If you use ~use-package~, here is the recipe for installing it.
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (use-package casual-dired
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map dired-mode-map ("C-o" . 'casual-dired-tmenu)))
#+end_src

If you are installing by using a clone of this repository, then ensure that the directory holding ~casual-dired.el~ is in your ~info-path~. Add the following lines to your Emacs initialization file.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-dired)
  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-o") 'casual-dired-tmenu)
#+end_src

Included is a standard keymap for Dired sorting commands (~casual-dired-sort-menu~) which can be included in a context menu for a mouse-driven workflow.


#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (easy-menu-add-item menu nil casual-dired-sort-menu)
#+end_src

Casual requires Emacs 29.1+.

* Usage
1. Invoke ~M-x dired~ to launch Dired.
2. When the point is in the Dired window, invoke ~C-o~ (or a binding of your choosing) to launch the Casual Dired menu.

** Enhanced Sorting
Casual Dired offers enhanced sorting capabilities through GNU ~ls~. Use this to sort your Dired buffer to preference. Filtering dot files by disabling the ~--all~ option is available here.

[[file:docs/images/casual-dired-sort-by-screenshot.png]]

With the *Sort By* menu raised, one can save the switch settings for future use via the binding ~C-x C-s~ (~transient-save~). Note this is a global setting and will apply to all future calls to the *Sort By* menu.

* Configuration

As Dired has been around for a long time, the different ways of configuring it are myriad. Described below is a configuration used by the author that is consistent with the bindings used in Casual Dired.

** Initialization

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'dired)
  (require 'dired-x)
  (require 'cclisp)
  (require 'wdired)
  (require 'image-dired)
  (require 'casual-dired)

  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'hl-line-mode)
  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'context-menu-mode)
  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'dired-async-mode)
  (add-hook
   'dired-mode-hook
   (lambda ()
     (setq-local mouse-1-click-follows-link 'double)))

  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "M-o") #'dired-omit-mode)
  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "E") #'wdired-change-to-wdired-mode)
  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-o") #'casual-dired-tmenu)
  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "s") #'casual-dired-sort-by-tmenu)
  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "M-n") #'dired-next-dirline)
  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "M-p") #'dired-prev-dirline)
  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "]") #'dired-next-subdir)
  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "[") #'dired-prev-subdir)
  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "A-M-<mouse-1>") #'browse-url-of-dired-file)

  (define-key image-dired-thumbnail-mode-map (kbd "n") #'image-dired-display-next)
  (define-key image-dired-thumbnail-mode-map (kbd "p") #'image-dired-display-previous)
  
#+end_src

** Variables

Casual Dired offers a settings menu to customize a set of commonly used Dired variables. Use this to customize your Dired behavior to taste.

[[file:docs/images/casual-dired-settings-screenshot.png]]

If you have GNU ~ls~ installed and configured, use the ~l~ key to set the variable ~dired-use-ls-dired~ to ~t~ ("Use GNU ‘ls’ with --dired"). Otherwise this should be disabled.

** UTF-8 Symbol Support

By enabling “Use UTF-8 Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual Dired will use UTF-8 symbols as appropriate in its menus. An example is shown below.

[[file:docs/images/casual-dired-screenshot-utf8.png]]

To ensure proper layout and spacing, your default typeface should be fixed-width or monospace and *must* support the UTF-8 symbols used.

* Common Menu Actions
Casual Dired is built using Transient menus and as such adopts much of its default behavior.

Each menu item has a /key/ and a /label/. The /key/ is what is typed by the user to select the menu item. A key can be prefixed with a meta (M-) or control (C-) key. Labels ending with a ~>~ character indicates that it will open another menu.

Dismissing a menu regardless of how deep you are in sub-menus can be done by entering ~q~. A menu can also be dismissed by entering ~C-g~, but this will return you to the parent menu.

If a mouse is available, a menu item can be selected by moving the mouse cursor over its label and pressing down button 1.

Pressing the ~?~ key will toggle help for all the menu items. Press the key of interest to get help for it.

Some menus (in particular the /Sort By/ menu) have arguments (example ~--all~) which you can set. You can persist these settings by typing ~C-x C-s~.

When a Transient menu is raised, a prefix argument (~C-u~) can be entered before selecting a menu item.

** Menu item notation
The following conventions are used to denote menu items.

If the label ends with a ~›~, it is a sub-menu.

If the label ends with an ~…~, the command will prompt you for an input value.
